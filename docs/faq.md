# FAQ

**Is this safe for fork PRs?**
Avoid `pull_request_target` unless you understand the security tradeoffs. Prefer updating badges on protected branches.

**Can I have multiple badges?**
Yes. Write to different `status-file` paths per workflow.

**How are statuses mapped?**
See `docs/status-mapping.md` for supported values and normalization rules.
